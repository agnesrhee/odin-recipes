    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is yet another simple recipe but sometimes the simpliest of recipes are 
        also the tastiest. Who doesn't like bread and avocado? I'm drooling just thinking
        about it!
    </p>    
    <p>You can add whatever you'd like to this recipe or remove whatever you'd like,
        it's all up to your preferences at this point! 
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Sourdough bread</li>
        <li>Avocado</li>
        <li>Coconut oil</li>
        <li>olive oil</li>
        <li>Red pepper flakes</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Toast the bread with some coconut oil until crispy on the sides.</li>
        <li>While it's toasting, slice the avocado in half and remove the pit.</li>
        <li>Once the bread is done being toasted, take the avocaodo and smash it
            with a spoon or fork onto the bread.
        </li>
        <li>If desired, add a little bit of olive oil and a healthy helping of red 
            pepper flakes.
        </li>
    </ol>
