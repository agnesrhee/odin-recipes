    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Sugar cookies are such a classic cookie! If this is your first cookie you're baking,
        a sugar cookie is what I'd definitely recommend. It's simple yet so tasty! Just as
        a disclaimer, it is not vegan or gluten free. Also, having a handmixer would be best
        but if you don't, no worries! You can still make the cookies.
